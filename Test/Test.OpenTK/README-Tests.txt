HOWTO add tests...

"TestFixture" classes and "Test" methods are sorted alphabetically in NUnit, and 
so they should be prefixed to order them from least-to-most complex

There should be no interaction between any two individual "Test" methods. 
Be careful not to make temporary files which might collide, or create dependencies
